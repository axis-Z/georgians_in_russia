# Georgians in Russia
January 27, 2023

This project looks at official statistics on migration and ethnic groups residing in the Russian Federation.
The data comes from the Federal Office of Statistics of Russia - rosstat.gov.ru

The main motive to look at these datasets is to debunk once again the myths spread by the Georgian ruling party on "Millions of Georgians living in Russia"
to legitimize its appeasement policy towards the Russian Federation and to use this narrative as a backdrop for the resumption of direct flights between the two countries.

As the dataset provided by the own Russian Federation, there are NO million Georgians living there. Quite the opposite, the immigration trend between the two countries changed dramatically, more Georgian citizens leaving Russia then going there.

The visuals given here help create some context for further discussions on Georgians living in Russia. It shows spatial patterns, as well as compares the numbers agains other post-communist countries.
